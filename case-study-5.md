## ✅ After Prompt:
**Prompt:**  
> Act as a mobile UI/UX designer. I’m building an app called “foodfLICKS” where users scroll through full-screen food reels and can order while watching. Suggest a clean, modern layout with:  
> - A reels feed like Instagram  
> - Swipe up to view recipe or “Order Now”  
> - Add to cart & payment options  
> - Mobile number login only  
> - Admin-only uploads

**AI Output:**  
- Home Screen: Vertical reel-style feed (like IG Reels), with like/save/order icons overlaid.  
- Swipe Up: Expands recipe details + price + “Add to Cart” button.  
- Cart Page: Lists selected snacks, quantity adjuster, total price.  
- Login: Mobile number with OTP verification.  
- Admin Panel: Reel upload page with fields for title, recipe, and price.

## 💡 Why This Worked:
The upgraded prompt gave a **clear app name**, **purpose**, and **features**. Framing it as a task for a **UI designer** led to structured, screen-by-screen outputs. Perfect for wireframing or dev handoff.
